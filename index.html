            <h3>Failure does not mean the end of life..</h3>
            <p>You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget
                the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time,
                or any of your space..</p>
